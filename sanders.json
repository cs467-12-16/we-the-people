Unacceptable! We expect good judgment from the start, the new high bar set by Bernie Sanders, who doesn't need to \"evolve\" over and over and over. \n\nHillary fully supported Bill, crushing black communities with: crack cocaine sentencing disparity law, welfare reform, and nafta... \n\nBernie Sanders fights for minorities. \n\nThen:\n\nBernie marched on Washington with MLK Jr. in 1963 and was at the \"I have a dream\" speech. He fought for desegregated housing in Chicago in the 60's and he was arrested for protesting against segregation. He campaigned and endorsed rev. Jesse Jackson in 84' and 88'\n\nHillary Clinton supported republican Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election; Goldwater voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (supporting segregation). In the 80's Hillary was a lawyer for Walmart from 86-92', working to DISENFRANCHISE the poor via walmart's anti-union / low-wage policy, protecting the Walton family wealth. Walmart then supported the Clinton's for Bill's 92' campaign.\n\nNow:\n\nBernie: conduct automatic federal investigations for anyone who dies in police custody (for Sandra Bland et al.). Hillary has nothing here.\n\nBernie: allow states to legalize marijuana and remove marijuana as a federally classified drug to help those affected most (minorities). Hillary wants to put marijuana on a lower drug enforcement classification but doesn\u2019t want it legalized. So minorities would still disproportionately go to jail and tax payers would still pay for a broke justice system. And needed funding wouldn't go to help schools and local gov. programs from taxing legal marijuana sales.\n\nBernie: provide \"postal-banking\" so basic banking services can be accessed by ALL communities, especially those underserved, minority communities where, instead of banks, people often must cash checks at pay day lenders for 50-200% interest because there are no bank branches. Postal banking is something many advanced countries (Japan, Germany, Korea, NZ...) already offer in addition to commercial banking. Hillary wants..... well, I'm not sure how she plans on helping minority communities??\n\nBernie: all public colleges and universities to be tuition-free by paying for it with a tax on wall street speculation. Hillary does not want tuition-free higher ed. but wants \"debt free tuition\" where broke families and teens still need to pay. = barrier to entrance\n\nBernie: universal healthcare for ALL, as a right, not a privilege. Hillary wants to strengthen Obamacare, which serves some.\n\nBernie: raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and the top 1-2% will pay for it. Hillary wants to raise it to $12 an hour. $12 an hour is not even a living wage for a single person and doesn't account for inflation. How is $12 an hour for a single parent??",

Nevada should of been a Bernie state!\n\nKey points of discussion:\n\n1. Democratic Socialism - Lots of misguided arguments. Know what Bernie means by it.\n2. Explanation of tax breaks, loop holes, and subsides.\n3. Explaining that \"free\" mean properly managing taxes for funding of these pograms.\n4. Make sure to express that Bernie DOES support planed parent hood.\n5. Once again explain we are funded by us the people for the people and we have no Super PACs.\n\nPlease become a part of this process in all of your states!

After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It\u2019s time to reshuffle this deck.\u201d #feelthebern\n\nWell the time has come.  A superhardworking, super passionate man almost 3/4 of a century old is fighting hard, selflessly, relentlessly to pursue a better future for not just us, but our future children and grandchildren. If it were any other ordinary politician (or businessman), after over have half a century of hard-served public service, they'd most probably be off relaxing on an island sipping Mai Tai's instead of campaigning so hard with NOTHING to benefit from it directly in their lifetime. Bernie Sanders is a statistical anomaly, or miracle as the superstitious would put it. Let's not ignore him, let's not take him for granted and watch him disappear cuz we may never get this chance again to improve our lives so drastically for future generations to come. Let us help him win this common sense fight for basic human rights of free health and education for the common people. #delayedgratification \n\nI already attended and graduated from the top university in Canada and have ZERO student loans. I already reaped the benefits of dual citizenship in a \"socialist\" country. You and I may be enjoying our lives currently living in this oligarchy, but have you no responsibility for your children's future and the future of your grandchildren? Vote for Bernie instead of behaving like extremely irresponsible, greedy adults only interested in instant gratification, destroying the future of our kids and the planet! #NotMeUs \n\nYou know that RICH uncle you have always dreamed of? Instead of just giving us handouts, we will earn what we deserve! Economists project income and jobs would soar under Sanders. Median income would soar by more than $22,000. Nearly 26 million jobs would be created. The unemployment rate would fall to 3.8%. This enhanced government spending would increase demand on businesses, who would then hire more workers to meet their needs. The increase in employment will prompt people to buy more, leading other businesses to hire. #socialdemocracy \n\nAs for human rights, just listen to him at the MSNBC Townhall, speaking out passionately against Racism, Sexism, Islamophobia, Xenophobia, and Bigotry! He's the first white candidate to publicly speak out against how disgracefully people have been treating our President Obama just because of the color of his skin and his dad was an immigrant from Kenya, comparing to his own white skin immunity from racism, even though his dad was an immigrant from Poland. #equality\n\n\u201cHillary, during the time Sanders was marching with the Civil Rights Movement, she was working for a Republican campaign.  To me, she\u2019s just a Republican trying to play a Democrat just so she has a chance at winning, that\u2019s all she wants. I don\u2019t need her to condescend to me and tell me that just because I\u2019m a woman, I have to vote for her because she\u2019s also a woman, and that\u2019s what she wants.\u201d #humanrights\n\nBernie's straightforward rhetoric, solid track record, campaign website and some more legitimate, factual research converted my husband to a Berner last week right in front of my eyes! His campaign is working overtime influencing the entire nation, one hardworking American at a time. Collectively we will change the course of this election! #metamorphosis \n\nOk Jane, I too love this man. How crazy is it this man actually encompasses all of my moral values and just plain common sense that I've had for decades? It's such a sigh of relief that I'm not alone in my views, and watching the entire nation supporting him just strengthens my belief in humanity and #humanism\n\nThank you for all the hard work, never get discouraged and always remember to look at the big picture! Please believe that all those hours we have put in phone banking, campaigning, fundraising, donating, etc WILL make a difference! Just take care of your health and stress level as well so you can enjoy those glorious days ahead of us. And boy, after feeling like you've lost everything, the moment things start to turn right side up we will be so ecstatic and feel like it's not even real, THAT moment will be so much more meaningful and will not ever be taken for granted after a fight so arduous and exasperating! #Berners \n\nLet's get out there and VOTE for our next POTUS! #pleasevote #bernie2016 #SenSanders",

You\u2019re intelligent, and the future holds no limits to where you can go, or what you can do.  You\u2019ve educated yourself, and grown to be a supporter of Bernie Sanders in his candidacy for President.  Bravo!  \n\nSome reading this will spend many hours clicking a keyboard to voice their support for the Senator.  Some might talk to their friends or family, co-workers or even fraternity or sorority families about the positive future his plan provides, and what it means to so many people.  From the homeless and poor to the average American family, you\u2019ve discovered an individual whose career and mission have been, and are, to improve the lives we, and future generations, will live.  You\u2019ve selected your candidate, and you believe in him.  \n\nIT\u2019S NOT ENOUGH.  \n\nNone of these things have the same meaning as actually casting a vote.  Here we are, just a few events into the primary season, and Bernie has done okay, but with you getting out and voting, he\u2019ll do even better, and bring the beginnings of a promising future to our nation.  It won\u2019t happen automatically, and won\u2019t be instant; but without your efforts and your actual vote, it won\u2019t happen at all.  You\u2019ve taken the first steps.  Please, don\u2019t stop now.  Register if you haven\u2019t, vote by mail if need be, and get to the polls or caucuses.  Yes, it\u2019s going to take a little effort, and a small portion of a single day, but that\u2019s a minuscule price to pay to brighten your future, and the futures of those who will follow you, as well as those of us who have preceded you, and served this country to be sure you would have this opportunity.  \n\nThank you for reading, and please vote.

However, it got shot down by the Democrats and Clinton administration. The concept of a \"Contract with America\" could still bring about real change - the kind of change the Sanders campaign stands on. Or perhaps, Americans really needs a \"Contract with Congress\" that stipulates term limits and lobbying restrictions. It's time for a commitment on paper that Americans can read and enforce. After all, what other career do you know of that pays a lifetime salary plus untold bonuses without an employment contract?",

I just got finished telling her that you would look nice with a mustache. Have you ever considered growing one, Mr. Sanders? If Abraham Lincoln can grow a beard because a little girl told him to, you could probably do the same in raising a mustache--you'd look distinguished and you'd be the first US President since William Howard Taft in 1913 to have one! This was just so you know. Thanks a mint!",

He attributes his \u201cmediocrity\u201d to lack of interest in studies, because he wanted to be more involved in community organizing, going out, not staying home with books. Another reason? He admired Hitler, as he says, for the power Hitler had over people. He was fascinated with this power and always wanted to follow a political career leading to such a position.\n\nAs a Young Socialist (member of the Socialist Party of America) he organized the first Chicago sit-in, protested housing discrimination, and marched on Washington in 1963 to hear Martin Luther King in person. Of course, he met Saul Alinsky and Noam Chomsky, even before he ran as a Democrat for Mayor of Burlington. No-one ran against him on the Republican side\u2026 He was a good mayor, they say, improving all public areas, making everything he could public: park, science center, embankment, housing\u2026\n\nYou can do that with a small town or even a small country, such as Denmark (population 5mil.), not with a country the size of the United States! Why? We want the individual to have the power. The power of each of us rests in how capable we are, how hard we work, what we earn and reinvest of our own volition. In short, private property equals freedom. Take away property, collectivize it, you have a nation of slaves.\" \"Finally, Jane Sanders O\u2019Meara was a social worker and community organizer in Burlington, where Sanders was Mayor. She became President of Burlington College, but had to retire in 4 years, fired for causing \u201ca toxic and disruptive environment.\u201d Her salary was $160K, severance pay $200K. Today, Jane Sanders O\u2019Meara is the one who decides everything regarding Sanders\u2019 policy and appearances. As he says, she is \u201cone of his key advisors, administrative & policy adviser, chief of staff and media buyer\u201d and, interestingly, Sanders credited her with drafting more than 50 pieces of \u201chis\u201d Congressional legislature.\n\nShall we vet our candidates or stay complacent and elect another puppet in the hands of political hacks and ideologues \u2013 this time the one who looks up to Hitler and Marx as paragons of political power?\" http://politichicks.com/2016/02/who-is-bernie-sanders/",

He knew that the traditional base for Democratic candidates wouldn't be sufficient to get him elected (it had failed John Kerry). So he too set out to weave a new tribe, a tribe that included progressives, the center, younger religious voters, weary veterans, internationalists, Nobel prize winners, black voters and others.\n\nMotivating the committed outperforms persuading the uncommitted. The unheralded success factor of Obama's campaign is the get out the vote effort. Every marketer can learn from this.

I admonish you to speak to the country and tell them the problems caused by the federal government and the Veterans Administration and their fraud against the total family by refusing to pay my family and myself for the wounds i received in line of duty while i served in the military in Vietnam. They have been ordered by the federal court to pay myself the income they have refused to pay me for my serve and wounds. which would have made a very large difference in  life. and my full belief is that the veterans of the United States of America. have more of a right to receive a income at the very top of the middle class in America for their selfless service to the nation. note the totally disabled veteran receives from $24,000-to $36,000 income per year while in the government pay's a first term member of congress over $200,000 and all the political contributions. Please past this on and think if you do not have a right to get a education to help yourself better support your family. Vote and get rid of any political person in congress it does not matter if there name has a Dem, Rep. or even Independent. stop political action communities and lobbyist making the illegal the same as we do for the drug dealers. because that is what they are going against the American belief in Freedom.   Remember the veterans of the united states have given there health and in very many cases there lives for you the have the right to vote so please do vote",

With the help of republicans, Clinton was eventually successful in drastically cutting the welfare program.\n\n Clinton also signed important deregulatory bills into law, like the Commodities Futures Modernization Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. \n\nMost economists blame one or both of these pieces of legislation with directly facilitating the housing crisis in 2008 (there is a robust debate about which one is more important, with economists like Paul Krugman leaning toward CFMA as the more important one while Robert Reich argues GLBA). Hillary Clinton supported these measures during the 1990s and has in some cases continued to voice support for them. Think about that  Bill signed all of this legislation into law. Bernie Sanders was against welfare reform and GLBA at the time (he voted for CFMA-it was snuck into an 11,000 page omnibus spending bill at the last minute).\n\nOn economic policy, contemporary establishment democrats have more in common with contemporary republicans than they do with the FDR/LBJ democrats. Carter and Clinton took the party away from economic progressives. The Democratic Party, which was once the party that saw economic inequality and poverty as the core causes of economic instability, now sees inequality and poverty as largely irrelevant.\n\nInstead of eliminating inequality and poverty to fuel the capitalist system and produce strong economic growth, establishment democrats now largely agree with establishment republicans that the problem is a lack of support for business investment.\n\nHillary Clinton is a neoliberal building on the legacy of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. She doesn't understand the pivotal role inequality plays in creating economic crisis and reducing economic growth. She has been taken in by a fundamentally right wing paradigm, and if she is elected she will continue to lead the Democratic Party down that path.\n\nBernie Sanders is a democratic socialist building on the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. He understands that inequality is the core structural factor in economic crisis and that growth in real wages and incomes is required for robust, sustainable economic growth.\n\nIt doesn't matter which one is more experienced, or which one's policies are more likely to pass congress, or which one is more likely to win a general election, or which one is a man and which one is a woman. This is not about just this election, or just the next four years.\n\nThis is about whether the Democratic Party is going to care about inequality for the next decade.\n\nWe are making a historical decision between two distinct ideological paradigms, not a choice between flavors of popcorn. This is important. Choose carefully.",

For example; for this revolution to materialize, the revolutionaries need to vote in a sympathetic Congress.  Also, Hilary states that BO took Wall street money;  suggesting he was not beholden to the big banks.  That investment banking and commercial banking operations of the big banks were not separated through legislation, suggests to me an influence of this money.  Possibly he thought the banks were still vulnerable, but now that they are stronger, separate the two.  Thanks for all you do Senator Sanders.  Love the logo with the silhouette of Bernie and the People within the silhouette.  It reminds me that the movement is more than about a person.",

Is she really willing to shoot down a Russian plane that violates the no-fly over Syria? She has tried to  re-write history regarding her own record of poor judgment: voting for the Bush/Cheney Iraq war, and even worse, her role as Secretary of State in helping to create ISIS and advocating for a policy of regime change responsible for much of the chaos in the Middle East.                                                                                                                             She raked in $600,000 for 3 thirty-minute speeches and thinks $15/hr is too much for a worker. This what is wrong in America - millionaires and billionaires think $15/hr is too much. Now, Hillary\u2019s speech-writing spin-doctors face the challenge of writing new speeches carefully calculated not to bite the hand that funds her. On the other hand, Bernie has the courage to lead by example and not accept money from big corporate donors. Bernie is a statesman with the policies, integrity, courage, and prudent judgment we need in the White House!",

Is this an important development on this ongoing Hillary EMail mess? Or is it more important to show video clips from the Colbert Show making a joke of it all. Let's just laugh it off? Do you think if she is the Democratic nominee the Republicans (Trump) will laugh it off? Don't think so. Bernie is the right choice at the right time. It's not even close. is it fair to the people of the United States to choose between Trump or a person that is asked, 6 months into the ongoing campaign: \"Have you ever lied?' And it's a relevant question? Are people going to say: \"well i voted for Hillary because she said she never lied?\" She's been in politics for 25 years and trust is still a concern regarding the person that Obama said was \"Wicked Smart\"? There's nothing to debate here. Bernie's integrity and passion to restore income equality and help the middle class is beyond reproach. Bernie Sanders for president!",

If anyone could use a good psychoanalyst, it is America (not Mr. Trump) but insurance companies have all but obliterated the concept from the national psyche. They pay us $60/hr if they pay at all.  The Father of Our Country died in our infancy.  What America needs NOW is a good Mother and you are the only candidate qualified for that job. Poverty hurts everyday. That's why the nation has an eating disorder and a heroin addiction. People are trying to deaden the pain. Poverty is traumatizing everyday. That's why poor folks are smoking more. It's to relieve stress, and not due to lack of education. Poverty doesn't go away when you win the lottery.  Poverty is a state of mind and will not disappear until someone invests in it. My question to you is, are you hiring? Because I speak from experience.",
