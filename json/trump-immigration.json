Donald Trump is the only candidate who can turn things around for America and should be taken seriously!!!\n2. He is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.\n3. He is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We dont need a policy expert or a legislator  we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.\n4. He is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.\n5. He is decisive. As President every decision he makes would be in the best interest of the country. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.\n6. He is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media  and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.\n7. He listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.\n8. His success is unmatched in the business world by all the others -\nHe attended one of the best business schools/ to make 10 billion dollars.\n9. Having an IQ of 157, his knowledge of contracts and negotiating is brilliant/ internationally/ unparalleled. No one builds an international business empire the size of Trump's without being able to win at the negotiating table.\n10. He was popular in the Apprentice/ number 1# rated program 10 years running.\n11. He wrote 10 best-selling books [ His book the Art of a deal [educational]\n12. He owns and operates Miss Universe/ Miss America] beauty pageants.\n13. Hes doing business worldwide therefore his experience is desirable/ knows cultures/international taxes/ pricing/ shipping/ unions/ regulations/ contracts/ business/ practices/ suppliers/ safety rules/ types of workers.\n14. Hes into construction, media, manufacturing, travel and publishing.\n15. Hes a job producer/ just for the records/ most of his CEOs are women/ yes they make more than the men/ creditability counts.\n16. He gives millions to charities.\n17. He understands currencies/ money exchanges/ inflation, deflation worldwide wages.\n18. His tax program 0-10-15-25 is simple.\n19. His universal interstate medical/ insurance program is very realistic/ competition.\n20. He has a good five point immigration program.\n21. Hes pro military & Vets [improve VA hospital/care] Take ISIS oil fields to pay Vets.\n22. He wants to seal off the boarder [build that wall] Hes built a 96 story building/ he thinks thats harder than constructing a wall. He understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.\n23. Hes anti-Iran deal/ pro-Israel. He says it states we have to protect Iran if Israel attacks [Iran keeps saying they are going to wipe Israel and us off of the map].\n24. His pro Christmas stance is anti [political correct].\n25. He also realizes that our nation is being trashed worldwide and speaks up about it.\n26. He recognizes the China money manipulation policy which is anti-USA.\n27. He says that Japans tariff on US goods [one way deal making].\n28. He wants to put a tariff on Mexican goods/ all traffic/ cut off aid.\n29. Remember when Trump said; we protect Saudi Arabia therefore they must pay.\n30. We fought and spend billions in Afghanistan to help those people and China is mining their minerals because the Obama administration is incompetent/ cant win at negotiating/ stupid leaders.\n31. Hes warning America of [Poisons vaccines] and the dangers.\n32. He wants a high tech military/ a world class military/ hardware/ hacking/ security [too good to fail].\n33. He realizes we have a Muslin problem in this nation.\n34. He thinks Obamas birth certificate is a fraud [check out his SS#, no draft card/ old pass port/ E-verification status, school records [remember his dad isnt American therefore he isnt qualified for the office hes in].\n35. He will work for a $1 per year salary, give the rest to charity and not accept the pension after presidency if elected.\nSUMMARY\nLike him or not, agree with him or not, it doesnt matter. So far Trump is the only candidate who has shown that he can up-set the apple-cart and make things happen and he is exactly what America needs at this point in time! Everybody should do their homework on the candidates. We must not listen to the political media. They are not going to tell you the truth! They have a way of twisting words for their own story and agenda! There is an important choice that each voter has to make. Either you cast your vote for another puppet candidate and support business as usual in Washington again or support Donald Trump and HELP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!2016", "Written by a Facebook member...a good read..........I've been thinking a lot about Donald Trump, people say that he doesn't have a platform, that he just wants to make America great again. I have something to say about that, Donald Trump is not telling you his plan he's giving you an outline. Why? Every time he brought something to the table, the other candidates take it and run. Such as immigration, the wall and other issues. I can guarantee you that he won't give you his full plans in detail until he standing at the podium next to one of the Democrats. That is when he will reveal everything. He doesn't need to do that now. Donald Trump is a visionary. He doesn't go into business without a strategy, and a form of negotiation already set. This man is prepared in business and it will be prepared when the time is right in a debate. He is a brilliant man, and he will not reveal his hand. He doesn't have to, he has his supporters. They believe in him, they know he could be the commander in chief and lead this country in the right direction. As far as foreign policy, you say he lacks. What I say is he knows the economy, he knows the about taxes, trade, laws, foreign values, he knows that inside and out because he's dealt with them for so many years. Now if he hadn't been good with dealing with the foreign market, he wouldn't be the billionaire that he is now. He is a international brand. He knows leaders and foreign dignitaries. He is an economic genius with the skills to make this country great again. By bringing businesses back into this country and creating jobs. This will only help our economy. He would protect the United States from those who want to do us harm. He loves this country, and. will do what he has to do to protect it. HE IS bold and brash, he says what he means it means what it says, and that is what we like about him so much. He will be a tough negotiator and our allies will know where he stands at all times. They know his word will mean something, and so will our enemies. This is a brilliant man who has focus and he is pragmatic. He knows how to solve problems quickly. He will surround himself with the best of the best in all branches of the government. You will not see our soldiers kneeling at the feet of Iranian, nor will you see Isis take over the world. You haven't seen the guy work yet. All you've seen is a businessman turned politician before your eyes. His supporters are standing shoulder to shoulder with him and will not sway. Lobbyist and special interest groups will no longer be able to line that pockets of our Congress and Senate. Because when they do, the Senates and congressmen will pass a bills and legislation and it will be a conflict of interest to the United States. No more will you have super PACs running this country. The media can ridicule Donald Trump and his supporters all they want, But we are digging in our heels. We will not be deterred. The fact of the matter is, you think Americans are stupid. But we are the backbone of this country. Americans will determine the vote, not the special special interest groups or the lobbiests. They will finally understood clearly. Our voices will be heard. We will support our troops and build up our military and take care of our vets. Because this administration has not had their backs, nor have they listened to our top military leaders. No longer will our military hands be tied. He will secure our borders and revamp our visa program. He will do everything in his power to keep American safe. He will call our enemies by name, radicals jihadist. There will no longer be political correctness, for it is destroying our country and dividing us. Americans are finally pulling together as one, United we stand, shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump"], "size": 63}
