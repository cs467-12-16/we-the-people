Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create...life. He had such a knowledge of the Dark Side, he could even keep the ones he cared about...from dying. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power...which, eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death...but not himself.",

It is written in the bible: Romans 10: 9 That if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. And all your sins will be forgiven, God only forgives sins through Jesus Christ. You can also go to a Christian church and tell the pastor you want to accept Christ into your heart, and he will pray for you and you will be saved, God bless you.",

He is the appointed messiah/savior of their group.\n\n* Ted Cruz has only been a citizen for about 19 months! He renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014 so he could run for president.\nThere are also other reasons that he is not constitutionally eligible, including the fact that both of his parents were NOT U.S. Citizens when he was born, only his mother was.\n\nWise up, he's not who you think he is!",

Ive been living my whole life in america and have always been a republican. Trump doesnt have my vote. The republicans are going to have 4 more years of being slaves to the democrate party.

The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don\u2019t need a policy expert or a legislator \u2013 we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.\n4. Donald Trump is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.\n5. Donald Trump is decisive. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.\n6. Donald Trump is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media \u2013 and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.\n7. Donald Trump listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.\n8. Donald Trump understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.\n9. Donald Trump has actually read the Bill of Rights, and is willing to defend its provisions. He is not afraid to speak about Christian persecution, and protecting gun rights.\n10. Donald Trump loves this country \u2013 and says so. He wants to make America great again\n(Cut and Paste-Spread the News)",

Just to remind us all...Trump said of returning land to state control:\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea because I want to keep the lands great, and you don\u2019t know what the state is going to do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI mean, are they going to sell if they get into a little bit of trouble? And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that should be sold. We have to be great stewards of this land. This is magnificent land. And we have to be great stewards of this land.\u201d\n\nBased on that...Cruz did an ad about how he supports giving land back to the states...and Trump doesn't.  True or not true?  Trump calls the Cruz ad a scam...and adds THIS genius to it:\n\n\u201cTed Cruz, he\u2019s got an ad, something to do with I want to take away your land and I want to keep it in the federal government.

It\u2019s a Cruz scam. \u2026 I am backing the federal government to keep the land that\u2019s owned by the federal government, and we should give that land to everybody and divvy it up or something. I\u2019m saying to myself, well, it\u2019s not a subject I know anything about. It\u2019s a hell of an ad. This guy is sick. There\u2019s something wrong with this guy.\n\nThe man just admitted what SO MUCH of his problem is.  He doesn't know \"what the hell they're talking about!\"  On ANY important issue.  He knows how to barf out the same tripe time after time...but he DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT...or what HE is talking about.  \n\nPlease Trumpbots, Trumpeters, Trumposites...wake up, join us on Planet Earth...before it's too late.",

Cruz is a pathological liar, hypocrite and backstabber.  Kasich is a nice guy, but not solid enough to be President.  Rubio has encumbered debt of his own, and just a little too wet behind the ears yet.  \nTRUMP is a self-made billionaire, owes nothing to panderers, lobbyists and has the spreadsheets to prove it.  Whether you love him or not, he's the only real candidate proven and driven for success. And that's what he'll do for America.  \nBelievers in Trump will not be swayed.

THIS IS A COPY OF WHAT I SENT.    TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 2016  6:45 PM\n\nHELLO:\n\nI DID NOT RECEIVE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT UNTIL 6:35  AFTER  I WAS HOME AND COMFORTABLE AGAIN.\nI DO WANT TO TELL YOU THAT \"I AM NOT HAPPY\" WITH THE LACK OF ORGANIZATION AND THE \"FARCE\" CALLED CAUCUS.  I \"ENCOUNTERED TWO EXPERIENCES OR MORE THAT SHOWS\nME THE CROOKS WORKING IN THERE IN TOP POSITIONS OF PLACING PEOPLE\"\n\nWHEN I WALKED IN, A WELL DRESSED MAN (NO NAME TAGS FOR ANYONE) SAID, \"I WANT TO MAKE YOU A TEAM LEADER\"   THEN A WOMANS SAID \"NO, SHE HAS TO SIT HERE\".\nHE WALKED AWAY AND I SAT WITH A \"GROUCHY DETERIORATED WOMAN\", WHO WAS VERY INSULTING.  SHE WORE A \"TRUMP\" TAG, BUT SHE WAS NOT A TRUMP PERSON. I WATCHED\nHER.  FINALLY, SHE WANTED A CHAIR TO BE PLACED ON TOP OF THE TABLE, WHICH WOULD BLOCK ME.  I ASKED THAT IT BE MOVED AND SHE TOLD ME \"MOVE\".  I DIDN'T ARGUE WITH\nSUCH A 'SMALL MINDED' PERSON.  I MOVED TO ANOTHER TABLE.  (THE TABLES WERE SET UP  FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE AND PLACE THE VOTE IN THE ENVELOPE, WHICH IS IN HER CONTROL).\n\nTHE OTHER TABLE WAS FOR 'RUBIO'.  THE STUPID WOMAN VOTED FOR RUBIO BECAUSE HIS MOTHER CLEANED HOUSES AND HIS DAD WORKED IN COMMON LABOR TO RAISE HIM.  SHE\nTHOUGHT HE HAS MORE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THEN DONALD TRUMP.  SHE WAS SO STUPID, I COULD NOT SIT THERE EITHER.  SO I WENT TO THE PERSON, SUPPOSEDLY IN CHARGE.\nHE ACTUALLY TRIED TO SABOTAGE DONALD TRUMP AND I CALLED DOWN FOR IT.   HE WOULD HAVE LOST TWO VOTES FOR DONALD TRUMP RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES.   HE SAID TO ME\n\"WE ARE ALL REPUBLICAN\".   I SAID \"THAT BADGE SAYS \"REPUBLICAN RNC\"  THAT IS THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DONALD TRUMP IS NOT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT.  YOU ARE TAKING TWO\nOF HIS VOTES BY TELLING THOSE PEOPLE THEY COULD NOT VOTE HERE BUT THEY COULD VOLUNTEER TO TAKE OTHER'S VOTES.   I THEN TURNED TO THOSE PEOPLE AND I EXPLAINED TO \nTHE TRUTH AND THEY LEFT TO GO TO THEIR DESIGNATED POLL TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.  THAT THANKED ME BEFORE THEY LEFT.\n\nI WAS NOT \"ALLOWED\" TO SPEAK FOR DONALD TRUMP  UNTIL \"AFTER\" ALL PEOPLE HAVE VOTED.   BUT RUBIO'S STAFF AND TED CRUZ'S STAFF WERE HANDING OUT FLIERS IN THE LINE.\nNO, I DID NOT LIKE WHAT I SAW.  ANOTHER PROOF THERE IS A LARGE MAJORITY OF CROOKS AND STUPIDS HERE.  AFTER DON JR. CAME AND I GAVE HIM A PACKAGE FOR (YOU)HIS DAD, I LEFT DISGUSTED WITH THE STUPIDITY AND LACK OF ORGANIZATION THERE. WHAT GOOD COULD I DO IF I COULD NOT SPEAK FOR YOU, INFORM, EXCITE AND PROMOTE YOUR TALENTS, SKILLS AND THE REASON WHY YOU ARE THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT?\n\nIT WILL BE A 'DIVINE MIRACLE' IF \"YOU\",  DONALD TRUMP WIN(S) NEVADA.  IT WILL BE FROM A LOT OF THE WORK THAT I DID OVER THE INTERNET AND FACEBOOK.  THE PEOPLE I MET TONIGHT HAVE NO CLUE OF WHAT VOTING IS ABOUT.\n\nI CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE, THE MONEY SPENT BY(YOU) DONALD TRUMP ON UNAPPRECIATIVE \"DUMMIES\".  THE HEAVENLY FATHER MUST REALLY GET UPSET WHEN HE LOOKS DOWN ON THE PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH PLANET.\n\nSO MUCH FOR TONIGHT.  IF I HEAR THAT MY WORK IS APPRECIATED, I WILL CONTINUE, BUT WATCHING UNAPPRECIATIVE PEOPLE AND BEING IN THEIR COMPANY IS NOT FOR ME.\nTHE RALLY WAS GREAT BECAUSE IT WAS IN UNITY.   IF THE SO CALLED \"ORGANIZERS\"  HAD PLACED ALL OF TRUMPS PEOPLE TOGETHER TO GET VOTES AND THE \"ESTABLISHMENT'\nCANDIDATES IN A GROUP, AT LEAST THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNITY AND HARMONY.  BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT.  AND THE TRUMP TEAM DID NOT WORK TO HELP\nDONALD TRUMP BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ANY WHERE THAT I COULD TALKING ABOUT HIM GIVING OUT STICKERS, FLIERS ETC.  \n\nCHRISTINA PRINCELY",

Someone who has NEVER been involved in politics nor KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, JUDICIAL LAW, OR ANYTHING REGARDING GOVERNMENT!!\nSeriously, DONT give our party to this man and dont give our country to him either. \nTrump is just like Obama with his \"CHANGE\" campaign but on the other side of the fence.

The name will not be here,because of his safety! I don't typically go on rants or express my political beliefs here, but    I just have to get this off my mind. As some of you know, I'm active duty Army. Aside from that, I am a medic. I've spent 3 years of my life overseas in both Afghanistan and Iraq. I've seen some pretty atrocious sites caused by war, from both sides. I've picked up blown up body parts of friends and I've saved the lives of guys who were trying to kill me and my guys right before I was keeping them from their 72 virgins or whatever they believe awaits them on the other side. Here is an unbiased truthful view to the Syrian refugee situation. My first deployment to Iraq, in 2006, my unit voluntarily ran a childrens burn clinic outside of the FOB. It was a constant target for attacks. You would think that people wouldn't shoot mortars or rockets at their own children, but you would be wrong. We saw hundreds of children, from infants to 18 year olds. The overwhelming majority of the kids we saw (90% or better) were clear cases of abuse. These parents were literally dunking their kids in boiling water, or throwing hot chai at their kids faces... Yes, we're talking about babies, toddlers, kids not even old enough to understand why their parents would do these things to them. HUNDREDS of kids... We saw quite a few of these kids that were sexually abused, both girls and boys. Their parents acted if nothing was wrong with this, even when confronted by our doctors. This is the mentality of their society, not the viewpoint of a few individuals... these beliefs have been accepted to the vast majority of these people. Many were educated, well dressed, well spoken men, but yet, they still raped their own children, and kept chai boys (if you don't know what that means, google it.) During that deployment, we also captured the 3rd largest EFP cache that had ever been captured. There were hundreds of copper plates, homemade explosives, fake curbs to house the EFP's, hundreds of mortars and rockets and howitzer rounds, even an anti-aircraft gun. All of these things came from one place, Syria. Almost every single IED or EFP we found or hit could be traced back to Syria... A lot of the terrorists we captured were from SYRIA... Imagine that. Fast forward a couple years, and I find myself in Helmand Province, in Afghanistan... We had a group of Afghani's that were paid to help guard our little mud hut in the middle of an Afghan village (I wasn't on a fob) These guys also kept a \"chai boy\" A boy, about 11 years old, who was there to serve these guys sexually. We heard him being sexually assaulted many times, but there was nothing we could do about it. We asked the police, the Afghan Army, and we were told the same thing every time.... it's their culture, and accepted as the norm.... Once again, we captured Syrian made explosives, weapons, and other items... We found Syrian passports during raids... And people out there want us to let these people into the US, with our kids, and near our wives. Near our schools, near our churches, synogogues, malls. Places where we should never have to fear being blown up, shot, kidnapped and tortured... Don't forget what they did to the Egyptian Coptic Christians, or the Jordanian pilot... Don't forget about what they do to rape victims! They stone these women to death for being raped! They behead their own people. Do you think they will show mercy to you? Look at the rape statistics in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium. Facts don't lie... 97% of rapes committed in Sweden were committed by Muslim immigrants... And you want 10,000 of these people here? Even if just 1% of these so called \"refugees\" were ISIS supporters or active ISIS terrorists, would that be acceptable to you? Chew on it... think about it. Take a good look at your kids or your wife and decide if the risk is worth taking. Feel free to share this if you want. #TRUMP2016",

Donald Trump is the only candidate who can turn things around for America and should be taken seriously!!!\n2. He is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.\n3. He is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don\u2019t need a policy expert or a legislator \u2013 we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.\n4. He is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.\n5. He is decisive. As President every decision he makes would be in the best interest of the country. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.\n6. He is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media \u2013 and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.\n7. He listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.\n8. His success is unmatched in the business world by all the others -\nHe attended one of the best business schools/ to make 10 billion dollars.\n9. Having an IQ of 157, his knowledge of contracts and negotiating is brilliant/ internationally/ unparalleled. No one builds an international business empire the size of Trump's without being able to win at the negotiating table.\n10. He was popular in the Apprentice/ number 1# rated program 10 years running.\n11. He wrote 10 best-selling books [ His book the Art of a deal [educational]\n12. He owns and operates Miss Universe/ Miss America] beauty pageants.\n13. He\u2019s doing business worldwide therefore his experience is desirable/ knows cultures/international taxes/ pricing/ shipping/ unions/ regulations/ contracts/ business/ practices/ suppliers/ safety rules/ types of workers.\n14. He\u2019s into construction, media, manufacturing, travel and publishing.\n15. He\u2019s a job producer/ just for the records/ most of his CEO\u2019s are women/ yes they make more than the men/ creditability counts.\n16. He gives millions to charities.\n17. He understands currencies/ money exchanges/ inflation, deflation worldwide wages.\n18. His tax program 0-10-15-25 is simple.\n19. His universal interstate medical/ insurance program is very realistic/ competition.\n20. He has a good five point immigration program.\n21. He\u2019s pro military & Vet\u2019s [improve VA hospital/care] Take ISIS oil fields to pay Vets.\n22. He wants to seal off the boarder [build that wall] He\u2019s built a 96 story building/ he thinks that\u2019s harder than constructing a wall. He understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.\n23. He\u2019s anti-Iran deal/ pro-Israel. He says it states we have to protect Iran if Israel attacks [Iran keeps saying they are going to wipe Israel and us off of the map].\n24. His pro Christmas stance is anti [political correct].\n25. He also realizes that our nation is being trashed worldwide and speaks up about it.\n26. He recognizes the China money manipulation policy which is anti-USA.\n27. He says that Japan\u2019s tariff on US goods [one way deal making].\n28. He wants to put a tariff on Mexican goods/ all traffic/ cut off aid.\n29. Remember when Trump said; we protect Saudi Arabia therefore they must pay.\n30. We fought and spend billions in Afghanistan to help those people and China is mining their minerals because the Obama administration is incompetent/ can\u2019t win at negotiating/ stupid leaders.\n31. He\u2019s warning America of [Poisons vaccines] and the dangers.\n32. He wants a high tech military/ a world class military/ hardware/ hacking/ security [too good to fail].\n33. He realizes we have a Muslin problem in this nation.\n34. He thinks Obama\u2019s birth certificate is a fraud [check out his SS#, no draft card/ old pass port/ E-verification status, school records [remember his dad isn\u2019t American therefore he isn\u2019t qualified for the office he\u2019s in].\n35. He will work for a $1 per year salary, give the rest to charity and not accept the pension after presidency if elected.\nSUMMARY\nLike him or not, agree with him or not, it doesn\u2019t matter. So far Trump is the only candidate who has shown that he \u201ccan up-set the apple-cart\u201d and make things happen and he is exactly what America needs at this point in time! Everybody should do their homework on the candidates. We must not listen to the \u201cpolitical media\u201d. They are not going to tell you the truth! They have a way of twisting words for their own story and agenda! There is an important choice that each voter has to make. Either you cast your vote for another \u201cpuppet candidate\u201d and support business as usual in Washington again or support Donald Trump and HELP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!2016\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

                    "message": "Written by a Facebook member...a good read..........I've been thinking a lot about Donald Trump, people say that he doesn't have a platform, that he just wants to make America great again. I have something to say about that, Donald Trump is not telling you his plan he's giving you an outline. Why? Every time he brought something to the table, the other candidates take it and run. Such as immigration, the wall and other issues. I can guarantee you that he won't give you his full plans in detail until he standing at the podium next to one of the Democrats. That is when he will reveal everything. He doesn't need to do that now. Donald Trump is a visionary. He doesn't go into business without a strategy, and a form of negotiation already set. This man is prepared in business and it will be prepared when the time is right in a debate. He is a brilliant man, and he will not reveal his hand. He doesn't have to, he has his supporters. They believe in him, they know he could be the commander in chief and lead this country in the right direction. As far as foreign policy, you say he lacks. What I say is he knows the economy, he knows the about taxes, trade, laws, foreign values, he knows that inside and out because he's dealt with them for so many years. Now if he hadn't been good with dealing with the foreign market, he wouldn't be the billionaire that he is now. He is a international brand. He knows leaders and foreign dignitaries. He is an economic genius with the skills to make this country great again. By bringing businesses back into this country and creating jobs. This will only help our economy. He would protect the United States from those who want to do us harm. He loves this country, and. will do what he has to do to protect it. HE IS bold and brash, he says what he means it means what it says, and that is what we like about him so much. He will be a tough negotiator and our allies will know where he stands at all times. They know his word will mean something, and so will our enemies. This is a brilliant man who has focus and he is pragmatic. He knows how to solve problems quickly. He will surround himself with the best of the best in all branches of the government. You will not see our soldiers kneeling at the feet of Iranian, nor will you see Isis take over the world. You haven't seen the guy work yet. All you've seen is a businessman turned politician before your eyes. His supporters are standing shoulder to shoulder with him and will not sway. Lobbyist and special interest groups will no longer be able to line that pockets of our Congress and Senate. Because when they do, the Senates and congressmen will pass a bills and legislation and it will be a conflict of interest to the United States. No more will you have super PACs running this country. The media can ridicule Donald Trump and his supporters all they want, But we are digging in our heels. We will not be deterred. The fact of the matter is, you think Americans are stupid. But we are the backbone of this country. Americans will determine the vote, not the special special interest groups or the lobbiests. They will finally understood clearly. Our voices will be heard. We will support our troops and build up our military and take care of our vets. Because this administration has not had their backs, nor have they listened to our top military leaders. No longer will our military hands be tied. He will secure our borders and revamp our visa program. He will do everything in his power to keep American safe. He will call our enemies by name, radicals jihadist. There will no longer be political correctness, for it is destroying our country and dividing us. Americans are finally pulling together as one, United we stand, shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump",
