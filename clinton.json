Unacceptable! We expect good judgment from the start, the new high bar set by Bernie Sanders, who doesn't need to \"evolve\" over and over and over with \"learning moments\" \n\nHillary fully supported Bill, crushing black communities with: crack cocaine sentencing disparity law, welfare reform, and nafta... \n\nBernie Sanders fights for minorities. \n\nThen:\n\nBernie marched on Washington with MLK Jr. in 1963 and was at the \"I have a dream\" speech. He fought for desegregated housing in Chicago in the 60's and he was arrested for protesting against segregation. He campaigned and endorsed rev. Jesse Jackson in 84' and 88'\n\nHillary Clinton supported republican Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election; Goldwater voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (supporting segregation). In the 80's Hillary was a lawyer for Walmart from 86-92', working to DISENFRANCHISE the poor via walmart's anti-union / low-wage policy, protecting the Walton family wealth. Walmart then supported the Clinton's for Bill's 92' campaign.\n\nNow:\n\nBernie: conduct automatic federal investigations for anyone who dies in police custody (for Sandra Bland et al.). Hillary has nothing here.\n\nBernie: allow states to legalize marijuana and remove marijuana as a federally classified drug to help those affected most (minorities). Hillary wants to put marijuana on a lower drug enforcement classification but doesn\u2019t want it legalized. So minorities would still disproportionately go to jail and tax payers would still pay for a broke justice system. And needed funding wouldn't go to help schools and local gov. programs from taxing legal marijuana sales.\n\nBernie: provide \"postal-banking\" so basic banking services can be accessed by ALL communities, especially those underserved, minority communities where, instead of banks, people often must cash checks at pay day lenders for 50-200% interest because there are no bank branches. Postal banking is something many advanced countries (Japan, Germany, Korea, NZ...) already offer in addition to commercial banking. Hillary wants..... well, I'm not sure how she plans on helping minority communities??\n\nBernie: all public colleges and universities to be tuition-free by paying for it with a tax on wall street speculation. Hillary does not want tuition-free higher ed. but wants \"debt free tuition\" where broke families and teens still need to pay. = barrier to entrance\n\nBernie: universal healthcare for ALL, as a right, not a privilege. Hillary wants to strengthen Obamacare, which serves some.\n\nBernie: raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and the top 1-2% will pay for it. Hillary wants to raise it to $12 an hour. $12 an hour is not even a living wage for a single person and doesn't account for inflation. How is $12 an hour for a single parent??",

While a student, Sanders was a member of the Young People's Socialist League. Bernie rose to national prominence following his 2010 filibuster against the proposed extension of the Bush tax cuts. Sanders favors policies similar to those of social democratic parties in Europe, particularly those instituted by the Nordic countries. He began his political career in 1971 as a member of the Liberty Union Party, which originated in the anti-war movement and the People's Party. Following his resignation from Liberty Union in 1977, he worked as a writer and the director of the nonprofit American People's Historical Society (APHS). While with the APHS, he made a 30-minute documentary about American Socialist leader and presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs. During his years as mayor (1981-1989), he called himself a socialist and was so described in the press. In 1990 Bernie was the first Independent elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since Frazier Reams' election to represent Ohio 40 years earlier. Bernie was sworn in as U.S. Senator in 2007. Which brings him to today running for the President of the United States. \n\nHe's a good man and I respect him but the question is, can he get it done? Is he ready? Is he prepared? Is he strong enough? No. Not compared to Hillary Clinton. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

Section 2071\n\nFormer United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it \"disqualifies\" her from holding any federal office.\n\nSuch as, say, President of the United States.\n\n\"If you do this or that bad thing, you've essentially disqualified yourself as being the leader of the free world,\" said Mukasey, referring to the illegal server and the illegal handling of classified materials.\n\nMukasey specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.\n\nFor those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:\n\nWhoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\n\nWhoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term \"office\" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nYes, it explicitly states \"shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\"\n\nShouldn't voters know that? The media isn't telling them.",
